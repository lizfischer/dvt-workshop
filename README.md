# dvt-workshop


## Setup
### Downloading workshop materials
Download this repository using the green "Clone or Download" button. Unzip the folder on your desktop. 

### Running docker
If this is the first time you're using the hipstas/dv docker image, get it by doing:
```
docker pull hipstas/dv
```
If this is *not* the first time you've done this, you may get an error that a container called dv already exists. Remove it by doing
```
docker rm -f dv
```
#### Mac
Open Terminal 
``` 
docker run --name dv -ti -p 8000:8000 --volume ~/Desktop/dvt-workshop-master/:/sharedfolder/ hipstas/dv bash
```

#### Windows
Open Command Prompt 
```
docker run --name dv -ti -p 8000:8000 --volume C:/Users/<yourusenamehere>/Desktop/dvt-workshop-master:/sharedfolder/ hipstas/dv bash
```

### All OSes
You're now in the terminal of the docker container. To get into the shared folder, do
``` cd /sharedfolder/```

## Running DVT on a video clip
 ```python -m dvt video-viz video.mp4```

### General Tips
If it looks like DVT has stopped running (i.e. the number has been stuck for a while), try pressing an arrow key while in the command window. Sometimes the status bar just hasnâ€™t updated and needs a little nudge to wake up.
