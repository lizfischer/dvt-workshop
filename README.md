### Running docker

```
docker run --name dv -ti -p 8000:8000 --volume path/to/folder/:/sharedfolder/ hipstas/dv bash

You're now in the terminal of the docker container. To get into the shared folder, do

## Running DVT on a video clip
 ```python -m dvt video-viz video.mp4```

## General Tips
If it looks like DVT has stopped running (i.e. the number has been stuck for a while), try pressing an arrow key while in the command window. Sometimes the status bar just hasnâ€™t updated and needs a little nudge to wake up.

## Viewing Output

python -m http.server --directory dvt-output-data
