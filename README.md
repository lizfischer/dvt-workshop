# dvt-workshop


## Setup
### Downloading workshop materials
Make sharedfolder
download zip, put in sharedfolder

### Running docker
If this is the first time you're using the hipstas/dv docker image, get it by doing:
```
docker pull hipstas/dv
```


Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows)
```cd ``` to your Desktop. Make a directory called "sharedfolder" on your Desktop, then do:
```
docker run --name dv -ti -p 8000:8000 --volume <path/to/Desktop/sharedfolder/>:/sharedfolder/ hipstas/dv bash
```

If this is *not* the first time you've run this command, you may get an error that a container with this name already exists. Remove it by doing
```
docker rm -f dv
```

You're now in the terminal of the docker container. To get into the shared folder, do
``` cd /sharedfolder/```

## Running DVT on a video clip
 ```python -m dvt video-viz video.mp4```

### General Tips
If it looks like DVT has stopped running (i.e. the number has been stuck for a while), try pressing an arrow key while in the command window. Sometimes the status bar just hasnâ€™t updated and needs a little nudge to wake up.
